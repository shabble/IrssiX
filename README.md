# IrssiX Module Collection

These are a collection of perl modules under the `IrssiX::` namespace which
provide various additional functionality for use in Irssi scripts.

## Description

The goal of this collection is to enable easier and richer scripting for the
[Irssi](//irssi.org) IRC client, by abstracting away some of the complexity, and
smoothing over some of the scripting API's sharp corners.


## Installation

Eventually, it will be available as a CPAN distribution for your deployment
pleasure.

For now, you currently need [Dist::Zilla](http://dzil.org/) to do the
various magicks. Once you've got that, a simple

`$ dzil install` 

is all that is needed.
